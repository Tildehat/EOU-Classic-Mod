# EOU Classic Mod
 Allows the creation of Gunner and Highlander classes in classic mode and allows traversal through Gladsheim 


This is available for the North American and European version of EOU

This mod allows you to create Highlanders and Gunners in EOU without the need of reclassing. This also allows access to Gladsheim in Classic mode.

Gladsheim areas can be access through a series of quest after reaching a new Geomagnetic pole. Accepting the quest will allow you to teleport to the Gladsheim area and Story mode events in Gladsheim will occur.
